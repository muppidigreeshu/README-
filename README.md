Online Blood Bank Management System powered by GEBS

Our project aims to provide a safe and secured blood transfusion.
-Blood transfusion safety is a relevant and significant public health issue. 
-Since most blood banks are still in paper-based system, various disadvantages are there. 
-As such, the researchers aimed to design, develop, and implement an OBBMS.

Despite advances in technology, nowadays, most blood bank systems are running in manual system.
When a person needs a certain type of blood and this type is not available in the hospital.
Family members send messages through social media to those who can donate to them and this process takes longer time.
This study aims to determine how the use of online bank management system enhance blood transfusion safety. 

This aims to design, develop and implement online blood bank management system an application provides:
To ensure hospital to have good supply or inventories of blood bags. 
 To check the availability of blood bags anytime. 
 To manage the information of its blood donor. 
 Function to check if the person donate blood for the last 3 months. 
 To allow good documentation about the donor and its blood donation activities. 
 Support fast searching to find match blood bags for the right person. 

we conclude that online blood bank management system is much better than the manual system. 
This shows that respondents prefer to use online blood bank management system rather than the manual system because it offers many advantages and benefits.
